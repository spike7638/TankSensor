.Change from touch pin to an ADC pin!

Do time-averaging of readings on a 1-second timescale

4B: Remove success/failure note as soon as any other entry is change
5. Clean up "data" directory as well. 
6. Code cleanup. Documentation of project. 
7. Improve sequencing of pages after adjustment of values
60 6. "Broadcast" the data in NMEA format? 
90 7A. Hardware setup: 220 ohm resistor means 4.4V at "full scale". 
   7B. Package the assembly: 24V supply; 5V supply (divider network???); display, touchpad>
Preliminary version: USB supply, 24V supply, display, touchpad
Remove the "/edit" option once things are set up!


* re-test OTA
