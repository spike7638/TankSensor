1. .Show current sensor value and 3 links on main page.
   .Also a "refresh" button that reloads this page
   .Connect sensor value to actual value with a "get" call  (test later)

1A. .Show current sensor settings
  .Cancel button that returns to sensor page
  .Submit button that checks password and either succeeds or fails.
  Copy to "data" directory in project so it doesn't get lost!

2. Show current system values (network name, sensor name (e.g., holding tank)
  .Submit button that checks password
  .Cancel button that returns to sensor page
  .Fill in current network and sensor names on load
  .For network change, do a system reset!

3. .Show current password and a system-reset button
  .Submit button that checks password
  .Cancel button that returns to sensor page

4. .Show "success/failure" for attempted modifications of any of these
4A: .Move success/failure to just below "Submit" button

4B: Remove success/failure note as soon as any other entry is change

5. Clean up "data" directory as well. 

6. Code cleanup. Documentation of project. 
7. Improve sequencing of pages after adjustment of values
Github
60 6. "Broadcast" the data in NMEA format? 

90 7A. Hardware setup: 220 ohm resistor means 4.4V at "full scale". 
   7B. Package the assembly: 24V supply; 5V supply (divider network???); display, touchpad>
Preliminary version: USB supply, 24V supply, display, touchpad

* re-test OTA
