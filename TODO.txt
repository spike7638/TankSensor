.Change from touch pin to an ADC pin!
.Do time-averaging of readings on a 1-second timescale
.5. Clean up "data" directory as well. 
.6. Code cleanup. 
.4B: Remove success/failure note as soon as any other entry is changed
.7. Improve sequencing of pages after adjustment of values

Change last button to Cancel/Done in all 3 html files
Re-upload all the html from the data directory to be sure it's all correct.

Remove OTA stuff and see whether OTA Upload still works

6.5 Documentation of project. 
   Esp. resetting the ESP32, re-uploading both the program AND the data files (need "edit" active on first use!)

6. "Broadcast" the data in signal-K format
